    # This is quite ridiculous, but not nearly as bad as what happens when you try to work around this.
    # The best way I initially found to solve this was to temporarily change the system path to include the dynamically loading module (and then we can even change it back afterwards).

    # In this case, it will be able to find relative imports -- but it will not realize that they are the same modules that have already been imported.
    # It will then re-import and created shadow versions of already loaded modules, wiping out class and global variables in the process.
