mlogger.py

This module defines classes and functions that assist in logging.

There are multiple classes that work together to create our logging system:
    * LogManager - the main supervisor class that manages a collection of Loggers
    * Logger - responsible for saving/writing a log event to some destination, and matching log events to decide whether to handle them
    * LogFilter - class responsible for deciding if a log message should be handled by a Logger; each logger has a list of zero or more LogFilters to check for match
    * LogTarget - destination targets for loggers; each logger has a list of LogTargets to send to on match

How these classes co-exist:
    * A site has a single LogManager; all logging functionality is done through that manager.
    * A LogManager manages a collection of zero or more Loggers
    * A Logger has a collection of zero or more LogFilters and a collection of one or more LogTargets
    * A triggered logmessage(Event class) is sent to the LogManager which sends it to each Logger; if a message passes the filters for a Logger, it triggers the targets for that logger

What are the goals of the logging system?

    * Provide a convenient syntax for adding both simple and complex logging messages
    * Support log messages with useful information like:
        * a dotted id path, to aid in filtering messages (e.g. "authentification.openid.yahoo")
        * numerical severity level, to aid in filtering messages and deciding who to email them to (e.g. from -100 to +100)
        * a short message "type", again to aid in filtering (e.g. "error" | "warning")
        * extras dictionary of arbitrary data to be serialized/stringified
    * Allow a collection of loggers to be configured that process log messages in different ways.  Each Logger may:
        * Filter on which log messages it cares about based on various patterns
        * Decide how to handle the log message, with targets that include:
            * Emailing log messages
            * Saving log messages to text files (rotating or otherwise(
            * Storing log messages in database tables
    * Additionally we would like to support things like queuing log messages for deferred handling (useful if we want to log to database but database is not set up yet).
    * Smart throttling if we are being overwhelmed with log messages
    * Smart digesting, if we have a bunch of messages to email we might want to send onlyh one email with all log messages for a given session

Some examples of things we will want to be able to easily do:
    * on severe errors trigger an email to admin
    * log "debug" messages to file only
    * turn off certain log messages with minimal cpu impact
    * discard warning messages when running in production mode
    * log messages of type x|y|z to database tables x, y, z
    * throttle log messages if they start to overwhelm the system
