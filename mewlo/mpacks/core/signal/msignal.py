msignal.py
This module contains classes and functions for the signal sending/receiving system.

The Signal system implements a kind of slot-filler, subscriber-receiver model, so that we can have many-to-many signal sending without senders needing to know about recipients.

Here's how it works:

A SignalDispatcher object is the central manager of all signals incoming and outgoing.

Arbitrary objects can register (with the dispatcher) in order to broadcast signals (they send them to the dispatcher);
 note that registering in this case does little -- ATTN:TODO add more about why to do this?

Arbitrary objects can register (with the dispatcher) in order to subscribe to receive signals matching certain criteria.

To receive messages, one creates a SignalReceiver object (essentially a wrapper) which specifies a callback function,
 a filter to define which singals to send, and additional parameters to pass to the callback function.

To broadcast a signal message, one simply calls the dispatcher broadcast function and provides:
    * id - a dotted path string representing the signal's name; the most common scenario will be when receivers match on exact signal message names.
    * message - arbitrary object representing the message contents; convention will dictate the type and contents.
    * request - reference to the current request being processed (useful to have for various things like logging)
    * source - a dotted path string representing the signal's "source"; convention may dictate use; can be useful as another field for filtering by recipients.
    * flag_collectresults - if True then a list collecting the the return values from the recipients will be returned; list is of tuples (returnval, failure)

There are some details of importance:

    * Rather than use a strict interface-signature typing to ensure that signals are parameterized correctly.
    * Instead, we use a very generic approach to signal formats; this makes things simpler and easier
    * But this puts more burden on subscribers to be careful processing passed signal parameters
    * We favor simplicity and avoid magic stuff that happens automatically; we do not auto-register signals.
    * The closest similar python implementation can be found in Django signals
    * We want to be as efficient as possible when we can be.


ATTN:TODO - There is a lot more to implement here.
