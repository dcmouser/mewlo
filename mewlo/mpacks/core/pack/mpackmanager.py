"""
mpackmanager.py
This file supports discovery and loading of modules by path and filename pattern

Note that our term "pack" here is not referring to python packs (directories).

The pack system here is made up of 3 classes:

    * MewloPackManager - holds a list of Packs.
    * MewloPack - a thin wrapper around a pack object.
    * MewloPackWorker - the object that will be subclassed to do real work.

The MewloPack is the thing that is autocreated on discovery of a .json definition file.
It will be instantiated even if this extension is disabled.

The PackWorker is only instantiated when the extension is enabled.

When you code a new plugin/extension, you ONLY create a derived MewloPackWorker class.
The MewloPack is created by the manager.
