Django
======

Python framework (not cms).

Things that Django does especially well:

    * It has a complete user (and group?) system.
    * See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/
    * And https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User
    * It has excellent online documentation.
    * Includes support for creating powerful admin interfaces easily.

Thoughts:

    * In "Pro Django" book, a weirdly complex mechanism for keeping track of "currently logged in user" throughout processing; perhaps because the concept of the currently logged in user is not a core concept?
    * In "Pro Django" book, a quite nice (though suspiciously automatic) system for keeping historical track of model changes.
    * Django may be the closest thing to Mewlo, and as such it may pay to spend some serious time contrasting it to Mewlo and thinking about how Mewlo is different.


Nice study of django complexity:
