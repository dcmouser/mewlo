Python framework (not cms).

Things that Django does especially well:

    * It has a complete user (and group?) system.
    * See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/
    * And https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User
    * It has excellent online documentation.
    * Includes support for creating powerful admin interfaces easily.

Thoughts:

    * In "Pro Django" book, a weirdly complex mechanism for keeping track of "currently logged in user" throughout processing; perhaps because the concept of the currently logged in user is not a core concept?
    * In "Pro Django" book, a quite nice (though suspiciously automatic) system for keeping historical track of model changes.
    * Django may be the closest thing to Mewlo, and as such it may pay to spend some serious time contrasting it to Mewlo and thinking about how Mewlo is different.
