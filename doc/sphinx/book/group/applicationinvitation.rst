Group Applications and Invitations
==================================

Group membership can be done in a variety of ways.

Some groups will be invitation-only, or require users to formally apply to join them.


Group Applications
------------------

When a group is available for applications, users may "apply" to join the group.  They fill out some info that the group may require on its application form, and then the application gets queued for review by group administrators.

When an applicaiton is queued for review, a notification will be sent to the group administrators, which the application will be reviewed by one or more group administrators who can approve or reject and annotate the application.

Approval is granted when the applicant receives X votes of approval from moderators (a level set by group); each moderator has a certain number of voting points associated with their votes.


Group Invitations
-----------------

Groups may also pro-actively invite a member (or even someone not signed up on the site) to join a group.  Such an invitation may include a message that will be sent to the user.  The invitation may be an invitation-to-apply, or an invitation whose acceptance grants immediate membership in the group with a specific role.
