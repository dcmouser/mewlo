Group Roles
===========

In Mewlo, group membership is handled via the RBAC permission system.

So, when we say that "User X is in group Z", that is internally represented by a role assignment entry saying that user X has role Y in group Z.

There are multiple role types that relate to group membership, and of course different group roles will have different permissions.


Some common group roles
-----------------------

Owner - A group may have multiple owners; there are owner transfer procedures; highest level of permissions
Administrator - Almost all permissions
Moderator - Ability to moderator content and members
