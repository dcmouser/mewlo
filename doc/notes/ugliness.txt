aliases with namespaces, especially for addons and url rel/abs stuff, have become quite confusing.


3/31/14:

we have several places where we are creating a set of registered components (site components (managers), hscripts).
inevitably these have to support dependency requirements, startup stage code, etc.
it would probably make sense to unify these things as component sets, addressable by name and with startup stage support.

imagebrowser ajax should be rewritten to return json data and let js script format it; that would be cleaner and substantially less bandwidth.

we are inconsistent and somewhat haphazzard in our passing of eventlist to some startup functions

we currently handle ASSETS and ALIASES with one class (assetmanager) -- should we separate?


5/22/14

namespace param is being passed in dif order for some functions -- standardize
we have some functions that are namespace and non-namespace enabled, but some are not used -- remove the unused ones
check the namespacedid function and see about enabling the option that doesnt add namespace when a namespace is already there
