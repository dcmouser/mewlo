aliases with namespaces, especially for addons and url rel/abs stuff, have become quite confusing.


3/31/14:

we have several places where we are creating a set of registered components (site components (managers), hscripts).
inevitably these have to support dependency requirements, startup stage code, etc.
it would probably make sense to unify these things as component sets, addressable by name and with startup stage support.

imagebrowser ajax should be rewritten to return json data and let js script format it; that would be cleaner and substantially less bandwidth.


5/22/14

we are inconsistent and somewhat haphazzard in our passing of eventlist to some startup functions


5/22/14

we currently handle ASSETS and ALIASES with one class (assetmanager) -- should we separate?


5/22/14

namespace param is being passed in dif order for some functions -- standardize
we have some functions that are namespace and non-namespace enabled, but some are not used -- remove the unused ones
check the namespacedid function and see about enabling the option that doesnt add namespace when a namespace is already there

The account siteaddon demonstrates some messiness regarding proliferation of "Managers":
There is msiteaddon_account and there is also msiteaddon_account_manager.
The first sets up the addon and routes.
The second actually has the functions called when visiting pages, etc.
Both are derived from MewloManager and thus have some duplicative content (sitesettings name, etc.)
This is messy.
(In fact there is a third+fourth file for an addon (*_mpack.py and *_mpack.json).
Can't we simplifiy?

There is some duplication of function in MewloManager (which many things derive from) and other things that are NOT derived from it.  For example see mhscriptmanager which uses also self.viewfiles[] and helper functions.
Should we make the self.viewfiles[] dictionary a full blown object?
